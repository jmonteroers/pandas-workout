6.3. Consider that youâ€™re in charge of vehicle licensing for New York taxis. Given these numbers, would more people benefit from smaller taxis that can take only one or two passengers or larger taxis that can take five or six passengers?
It would be more efficient to have a fleet of smaller taxis. However, the effect on taxi rides with small numbers of passengers depends on preferences.
